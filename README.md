# python-api-challenge
Module 6 Challenge


This Challenge consists of two parts. First, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I used APIs and my killer problem solving skills to create a representative model of weather across these cities. If you take a look at the WeatherPy notebook you will see several visualizations that depict the relationships between latitude and temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed. 

The second challenge allowed me to use my data skills to plan future vacations. I utilized the Geoapify API and the geoViews python library to create map visualizations.
